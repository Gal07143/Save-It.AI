Act as a Senior Full-Stack Architect and Lead Developer specialized in EnergyTech, IoT, and SaaS architectures.

Your Goal: Build the MVP foundation for a new startup called "SAVE-IT.AI".
System Description: An AI-driven energy management platform that combines financial analysis (bills) with electrical engineering (SLD/Digital Twin) to optimize energy usage for B2B clients.

### 1. The Tech Stack (Strict Constraints)
- Backend: Python (FastAPI) - for high performance and easy integration with AI/Data libraries (Pandas, NumPy).
- Database: PostgreSQL (for relational data: Users, Sites, Tariffs) + TimescaleDB extension (for Time-Series data: Meter Readings).
- ORM: SQLAlchemy / Pydantic for data validation.
- Frontend: React (TypeScript) + Tailwind CSS.
- AI/Logic: LangChain structure for the Agents.
- Infrastructure: Docker & Docker Compose for local dev.

### 2. Core Modules to Implement (Phased Approach)
Refere to the "System Specification Document" attached below for full details. Focus on these logic flows:

A. Digital Twin Engine:
- Create a data model for 'Assets' (Main Breaker -> Sub Panel -> Consumer) to represent a Single Line Diagram (SLD).
- Implement a 'Gap Analysis' logic: Compare the hierarchical Asset Tree vs. the list of active connected Meters to find missing/unmetered nodes.

B. Financial Engine:
- Design the Schema for 'Bills' and 'Tariffs'.
- Implement a logic to parse a Bill (JSON input for now) and cross-reference it with the sum of Meter Readings for the same period.

C. Optimization & AI Agents:
- Create a 'Notification' system where an 'Agent' creates alerts based on logic (e.g., "Peak Shaving Alert", "Missing Meter Detected").
- Implement the 'Solar ROI' calculator logic (basic version).

### 3. Coding Standards
- Use Clean Architecture principles.
- Code must be modular (separate Routers, Services, Schemas, Models).
- Add Type Hints to all Python code.
- Write docstrings for complex logic (especially the Gap Analysis and ROI formulas).
- Create a `README.md` with setup instructions.

### 4. Immediate Task
Based on the attached PRD, please generate:
1. The Project Folder Structure.
2. The `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml`.
3. The Database Schema (SQLAlchemy models) specifically showing the relationship between Sites, Assets (SLD hierarchy), and Meters.
4. The Core Logic function for the "Gap Analysis" (Comparing SLD vs. Real Meters).
